[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), a popular Computer Vision package, is a great tool to work with images, and provides a lot really useful tools that you can use to edit, transform, and work with your images. Python's OpenCV is actually a **wrapper** on top of the C/C++ implementation of the library, which makes it really fast. In addition, everything in OpenCV can be converted to and from [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) arrays, a really nice way to work with multidimensional objects like matrices and tensors. Like OpenCV, all Python calls to the Numpy library actually get converted and executed into C, which makes it really fast as well.\n",
